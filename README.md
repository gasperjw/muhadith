### Description:

This interactive map showcases the major **MuhaddithÅ«n** (scholars of Hadith) across different regions and time periods in Islamic history. Each marker represents a scholar, indicating their place of residence, their known works, and the year they were born (in the Islamic calendar). 

You can filter the scholars by adjusting the **Born Year (AH)** range using the slider on the left sidebar. This feature allows you to explore scholars from different centuries and understand their geographical distribution. 

Click on any marker to learn more about the scholar, including:
- Name
- Major works
- Born year
- Residence

The map automatically groups close markers into clusters, but you can zoom in to view and interact with individual markers.
